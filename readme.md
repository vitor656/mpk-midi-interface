# Connecting Mpk Mini II to Roland Midi interface

Script for connection between Midi Controller Mpk Mini II and Roland Midi Interface. 
It makes the Raspberry Pi a communication adapter/bridge between the midi controller
and the Roland interface. 

It was made to be able to use the MpK Mini as the main
midi controller to play a Roland Boutique JU-06 synth module since the mentioned
midi controller is not able to transfer midi data throught midi cables, it only
has a usb port.

Mpk Mini -> Raspberry Pi -> Roland Midi Interface -> Roland Boutique JU-06
